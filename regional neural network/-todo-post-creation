Once we have created detailed designs for each regional neural network, we can start with the implementation and testing phase. 

We can begin by implementing and optimizing each regional neural network and then integrating them into the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK. 
We can use relevant data and learning techniques to train and optimize the neural networks, ensuring that they perform as expected.
