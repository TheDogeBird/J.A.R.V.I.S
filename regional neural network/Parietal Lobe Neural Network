Input Layer: Receives input data related to object identification and spatial relationships from the user interface or other sources.

Output Layer: Delivers output related to object identification and spatial relationships to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK.

Functionality: This neural network models the parietal lobe region of the brain, which is responsible for object identification and spatial relationships. Its functionality will include processes such as identifying and analyzing spatial relationships between objects, detecting and identifying objects based on their physical properties, and detecting and analyzing motion and speed of objects.

Connection to MASTER NEURAL NETWORK: The Parietal Lobe Neural Network will connect to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK via a bidirectional communication channel, allowing for efficient information flow.
