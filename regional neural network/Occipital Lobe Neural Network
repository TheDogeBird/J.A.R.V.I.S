Input Layer: Receives input data related to visual processing from the user interface or other sources.

Output Layer: Delivers output related to visual processing to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK.

Functionality: This neural network models the occipital lobe region of the brain, which is responsible for visual processing. 
Its functionality will include processes such as detecting and identifying visual stimuli, processing visual information such as color, shape, and motion, and interpreting visual information to form mental images.

Connection to MASTER NEURAL NETWORK: The Occipital Lobe Neural Network will connect to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK via a bidirectional communication channel, allowing for efficient information flow.
