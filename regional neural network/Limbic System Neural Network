Input Layer: Receives input data related to emotion, motivation, learning, and memory from the user interface or other sources.

Output Layer: Delivers output related to emotion, motivation, learning, and memory to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK.

Functionality: This neural network models the limbic system region of the brain, which is responsible for emotion, motivation, learning, and memory. 
Its functionality will include processes such as processing emotional and motivational information, forming associations between different types of information, and forming and retrieving memories based on past experiences.

Connection to MASTER NEURAL NETWORK: The Limbic System Neural Network will connect to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK via a bidirectional communication channel, allowing for efficient information flow.
