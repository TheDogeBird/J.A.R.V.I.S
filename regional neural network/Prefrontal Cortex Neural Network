Input Layer: Receives input data related to executive functions, decision-making, and planning from the user interface or other sources.

Output Layer: Delivers output related to executive functions, decision-making, and planning to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK.

Functionality: This neural network models the prefrontal cortex region of the brain, which is responsible for executive functions, decision-making, and planning. Its functionality will include processes such as analyzing and evaluating different options, selecting the best option, and planning and coordinating actions based on the chosen option.

Connection to MASTER NEURAL NETWORK: The Prefrontal Cortex Neural Network will connect to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK via a bidirectional communication channel, allowing for efficient information flow.
