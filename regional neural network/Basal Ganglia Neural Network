Input Layer: Receives input data related to movement coordination and reward processing from the user interface or other sources.

Output Layer: Delivers output related to movement coordination and reward processing to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK.

Functionality: This neural network models the basal ganglia region of the brain, which is responsible for movement coordination and reward processing. Its functionality will include processes such as coordinating and controlling movement, processing and interpreting reward-related information, and adjusting behavior based on feedback.

Connection to MASTER NEURAL NETWORK: The Basal Ganglia Neural Network will connect to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK via a bidirectional communication channel, allowing for efficient information flow.
