Input Layer: Receives input data related to hearing, memory, emotion, and some aspects of language from the user interface or other sources.

Output Layer: Delivers output related to hearing, memory, emotion, and some aspects of language to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK.

Functionality: This neural network models the temporal lobe region of the brain, which is responsible for hearing, memory, emotion, and some aspects of language.
Its functionality will include processes such as processing auditory information, storing and retrieving long-term and short-term memories, processing emotional information, and processing some aspects of language.

Connection to MASTER NEURAL NETWORK: The Temporal Lobe Neural Network will connect to the MASTER NEURAL NETWORK via a bidirectional communication channel, allowing for efficient information flow.
