Project setup and preparation

1. Set up the development environment and tools
	- Choose the appropriate AI frameworks and libraries (e.g., TensorFlow.js, Brain.js)
	- Research and gather resources on brain regions and their functions
	- High-level architecture design

2. Define the structure of the master neural network
	- Define the regional neural networks representing different brain areas
	- Design the communication channels and interfaces between networks
	- Plan the implementation of the folded cortex representation
	- Master neural network implementation

3. Develop the input and output layers of the master neural network
	- Implement the communication interfaces for managing connections with regional neural networks
	- Set up methods for aggregating and processing data from regional networks
	- Folded cortex representation

4. Design the hierarchical structure for the folded cortex
	- Implement the layers and sub-layers within the neural network
	- Ensure that the representation enables more interconnections and higher functions
	- Regional neural network implementation

5. Develop individual neural networks for each brain region (e.g., prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, amygdala, primary motor cortex)
	- Implement the input and output layers for each regional network
	- Establish connections between regional networks, circuits, and neuron tracts
	- Integration and testing

6. Integrate regional neural networks with the master network and folded cortex representation
	- Test the overall functionality of the system
	- Ensure seamless communication between networks and proper output delivery
	- Training and optimization (initial phase)

7. Train the individual networks with relevant data
	- Optimize the performance of each regional network
	- Fine-tune the connections and weights within the networks
	- User interface development (basic version)

Design a simple user interface for interacting with the AI system
Implement methods for issuing commands and receiving output from the master neural network
